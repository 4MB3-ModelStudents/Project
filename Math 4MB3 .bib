@article{Liu2009,
abstract = {Spatially explicit models are widely used in today's mathematical ecology and epidemiology to study$\backslash$n persistence and extinction of populations as well as their spatial patterns. Here we extend the$\backslash$n earlier work on static dispersal between neighboring individuals to the mobility of individuals as$\backslash$n well as multi-patch environments. As is commonly found, the basic reproductive ratio is maximized$\backslash$n for the evolutionarily stable strategy for disease persistence in mean field theory. This has$\backslash$n important implications, as it implies that for a wide range of parameters the infection rate tends$\backslash$n to a maximum. This is opposite to the present result obtained from spatially explicit models, which$\backslash$n is that the infection rate is limited by an upper bound. We observe the emergence of trade-offs of$\backslash$n extinction and persistence for the parameters of the infection period and infection rate, and show$\backslash$n the extinction time as having a linear relationship with respect to system size. We further find$\backslash$n that higher mobility can pronouncedly promote the persistence of the spread of epidemics, i.e., a$\backslash$n phase transition occurs from the extinction domain to the persistence domain, and the wavelength of$\backslash$n the spirals increases with the mobility ratio enhancement and will ultimately saturate at a certain$\backslash$n value. Furthermore, for the multi-patch case, we find that lower coupling strength leads to$\backslash$n anti-phase oscillation of the infected fraction, while higher coupling strength corresponds to$\backslash$n in-phase oscillation.},

@article{Lloyd1996,
abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity is believed to play an important role in the persistence and dynamics of epidemics of childhood diseases because asynchrony between populations within different regions allows global persistence, even if the disease dies out locally. A simple multi-patch (metapopulation) model for spatial heterogeneity in epidemics is analysed and we examine conditions under which patches become synchronized. We show that the patches in non-seasonal deterministic models often oscillate in phase for all but the weakest between patch coupling. Synchronization is also seen for stochastic models, although slightly stronger coupling is needed to overcome the random effects. We demonstrate that the inclusion of seasonal forcing in deterministic models can lead to the maintenance of phase differences between patches. Complex dynamic behaviour is observed in the seasonally forced spatial model, along with the coexistence of many different behaviours. Compared to the non-spatial model, chaotic solutions are observed for weaker seasonal forcing; these solutions have a more realistic minimum number of infectives.},
